What The Frog?
==============

A game of jumping with limited moves.

Guide the frog to collect flies and fish. (Frogs eat small fish, worms, and
all kinds of other things, not just flies!)


Playing the game
----------------

Controls are displayed in the game.

I prefer the QWE/ASD controls but this takes some getting used to.


Installation
------------

Everything you need can be installed with pip (and I believe everything is
available cross-platform):

    pip install -r requirements.txt
